                <p class="paragraph">
                    I grew up in Beaverton, Oregon and came back to the area post-college. I worked in investment consulting for a number of years. It was dreary and lame. I met a friend through my wife who had completed CodeFellows here in PDX, and after a year or so of intermittent discussions, I decided I needed to quit my job and pursue a career as a software developer. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Outside of Alchemy, my wife and I live in Beaverton, and hang out mostly with our cool puppy, Timber. I play golf, hike, do triathlons, and generally enjoy everything outdoors. We love to travel and explore new places, try new things, taste new food, and speak new languages! 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I'm not entirely sure what my hopes and aspirations are after Alchemy (beyond the immediate goal of getting a job as a software developer!). I do think it would be enjoyable to work as a dev for serveral years, and perhaps move into product management. Who knows, all I know is I'm excited!
